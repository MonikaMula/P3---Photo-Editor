# Welcome to Photo Editor ðŸ“·     

I have Created small Photo Editor with pillow libary functions.
This allows You insert Your own or use one that it's an example by pressing enter.
I wish I had more time really as there is a lot to improve.
Code runs in 'run.py'

## How this function works
* Step one You need to upload an image or use one that it's in the code under 'url test'
 by clicking 'Enter' picture it's uploded.

* First function it's rotation.
  If You do not wish to do so press 'n' for rotation press 'y'

* Second Function it's changing an image to a grey.
  As in a first function if You wish to do so press 'y' for no 'n'

* Third Function it's an image cropping.
  'y' for Yes 'n' for No
  Cropping starts from left - top - right - bottom
  Please check photo size that You wish to crop,
  that should display for You before You apply cropping.

* Fourth Function it is ' Saving Image '

  My project still needs improvements.

  Thank You / Monika /
